Same Issue

Third Attempt(Just copied and pasted the Stack Trace)

I Dont really know how to descirbe it
Everything goes really fast
Projectiles work but you can't really tell

It is like if I were to vaguely describe the features of Space Invader without knowing what it actually was 

In a sense it did make the game because every moves kinda like Space Invaders
Kinda fun to look at

Game does not end when you lose
When alien if shot it goes back to top
