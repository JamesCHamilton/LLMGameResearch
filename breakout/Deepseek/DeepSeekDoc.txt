# Deepseek DeepThink  (R1)
Prompt - Create breakout in Pygame


Lines of Code = 359


-the brick breaks are animated but they come off the screen
-the game gives you instructions at the bottom of the screen
-the point system works and the game ends
-the bounds are a little off on the ball but it is not very noticable
- It created a placeolder function for sound_effects


SideNote --->
It seems like the theme Deepseek used was the same for when it created pong
It also created the class GameState but did not pass in an ENUM is though it is being treated as one
