Two-player paddle control (W/S and UP/DOWN).

Ball bounces off paddles and walls.

Scoring system.

Infinite game (until game close)

* If a player scores then the ball will spawn in at the same angle that it was last past at.
(Eg. if ball spawns in at 160 degrees spawning down and player two hits it and scores, the ball will respawn at the same
angle and in the same direction)
